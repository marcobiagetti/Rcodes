sapply(1:3,function(x) sum(m[,x]^2))#vector
lapply(1:3,fuction(x) sum(m[,x]^2)) #list by column
unlist(lapply(1:3,function(x) sum(m[,x]^2))) #equivalent to sapply
#differences: in apply we recall the entire object and the rows=1 col=2
# in sapply, lapply we recall numbers then call them again in the function as indexes of columns or rows
